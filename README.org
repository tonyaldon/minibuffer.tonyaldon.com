** browser-sync

I'm using [[https://www.browser-sync.io/][browser-sync]] to get hot reload when coding.

Then, to start a server that automatically reload when files change on
the system, run the command:

#+BEGIN_SRC tms
$ cd public
$ browser-sync start -s -w --files "*"
#+END_SRC

If it doesn't work, add just before the closing ~</body>~ tag of
[[file:index.html][/public/index.html]] file the snippet printed by the command
~browser-sync start~.  Then rerun the commands above.

** lighthouse

I'm using [[https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/][lighthouse]] to improve the quality of the webpage.

You can install the command line ~lighthouse~ by running the following
command:

#+BEGIN_SRC tms
$ sudo npm install -g lighthouse
#+END_SRC

When using ~brower-sync~ as describe in the previous section, the web
page is served at ~localhost~ on port ~3000~.  So to get the quality
report of the web page given by ~lighthouse~, you just have to run the
following command:

#+BEGIN_SRC tms
$ lighthouse http://localhost:3000 --view
#+END_SRC

Then you can read the report in your browser.
